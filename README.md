This is a prototype that was created for a class while at USC. This game led to another, more complex game called Healing Beat, which will be linked below.

Bad to the bone with our second round of prototypes!


For this week I wanted to try my hand at building my first VR prototype. It features a lot of essential features, such as moving, 
interactable objects, raycasting beam functionality, particle effects, and basic 3D sound. I wanted to test if being in a tunnel with the walls 
moving around you would cause simulator sickness. I found I needed to decrease the speed of which the objects were moving, but this has caused the game to be 
less thrilling and challenging. Nevertheless, it has a basic pointing and response function and is still fun to play (and works on a computer too)! I also 
wanted to experiment if particles would impact the framerate of the game, which it does not. Another goal of mine was to ensure the FPS stayed at 72fps at all 
time, which I accomplished in this prototype.
